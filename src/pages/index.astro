    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p>
      ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tripp, a Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience programming in
      various languages, environments, and industries. Most of my experience is
      working on .NET projects using C# and JavaScript. Some modern, some
      legacy. Some large, some small.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a polyglot programmer and love learning new languages, tools, and
      paradigms. I've recently been learning more about other programming
      languages on the website <a href="https://exercism.org">Exercism</a>,
      which has many language tracks and programming exercises.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting and check out some of my other sites!</p>
